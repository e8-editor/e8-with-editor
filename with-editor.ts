// a program E8 runs, as git commit or git rebase -i, gets an editor
// that tells E8 which file to edit and waits; E8 visits it in
// with-editor-mode, where C-c C-c finishes and C-c C-k cancels, and the
// program goes on. This is with-editor's "sleeping editor", which prints
// the request on the program's output and sleeps until E8 signals it.
